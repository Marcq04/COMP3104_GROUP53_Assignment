The COMP 3104 DevOps course introduces students to the principles and practices of DevOps. It covers topics such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, and cloud computing, enabling students to improve the efficiency and reliability of software development and operations.

The COMP 3104 DevOps course at George Brown College covers the essential practices of DevOps, 
focusing on automation, continuous integration (CI), and continuous delivery (CD). 
Students learn how to use tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes to automate workflows and 
streamline development processes. The course emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams, 
leading to faster software deployment and more efficient system management.

Tools: In the COMP 3104 DevOps course, students get hands-on experience with a variety of essential tools used in the industry, including:

Git for version control
Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
Docker for containerization
Kubernetes for container orchestration
Ansible and Terraform for infrastructure automation
AWS and Azure for cloud computing services

CI/CD Processes: Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are core practices in DevOps that enhance software development efficiency. CI involves the frequent integration of code changes into a shared repository, enabling automated testing to identify issues early. CD extends this by automating the deployment process, allowing teams to release updates to production rapidly and reliably. Tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitLab CI are commonly used to implement CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that software can be delivered to users quickly and with minimal manual intervention. This process fosters a culture of collaboration, reduces integration problems, and accelerates feedback loops.
