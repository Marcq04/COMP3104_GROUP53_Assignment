Learning DevOps is crucial in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) because it bridges the gap between development and operations teams. By integrating DevOps practices, organizations can achieve faster deployment cycles, enhanced collaboration, and more reliable software delivery, improving the overall quality and speed of development.

DevOps plays a crucial role in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by bridging the gap between 
development and operations teams. It enables continuous feedback, automation of repetitive tasks, and 
faster testing and deployment processes. DevOps helps in reducing the time between writing code and deploying 
it to production, which improves the overall efficiency of the development cycle.

By integrating tools for monitoring, testing, and deployment, DevOps ensures that every stage of the SDLC is streamlined, 
leading to quicker releases and improved software quality. The collaboration between teams also minimizes risks and 
allows for early detection of bugs and issues.
